One operating funtion I have on my IPad and IPhone is the security. I have the password, facial and fingure print on them. I use it because I have little kids around my elctronics and I have important pictures and information on them and I do not want them to accidentally delete it. I also have it because just incase I do loose my stuff I can see where and who opened my information.
