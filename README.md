One operating function I have on my iPad and iPhone is the security. I have the password, facial and fingre print on them. I use it because I have little kids around my electronics and I have important pictures and information on them and I do not want them to accidentally delete it. I also have it because just in case I do lose my stuff I can see where and who opened my information. 
Another operating function is power button. Without this button there wouldn't be any power to turn on your phone/coputer or shutting down your phone or computer. When you are tuning on your computer/phone you are running tests and your computer sending a message to every other operating systems to wake up. Truning off means you are saving everything you have done to your hard drive instead of RAM. While it's on you are saving a small amount of memeory to RAM.
