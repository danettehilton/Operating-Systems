One operating function I have on my IPad and IPhone is the security. I have the password, facial and fingure print on them. I use it because I have little kids around my elctronics and I have important pictures and information on them and I do not want them to accidentally delete it. I also have it because just incase I do loose my stuff I can see where and who opened my information. 
Another operating function is power buttom. Without this button there wouldn't be any power to turn on or off your computer or even shutting down your phone or computer. When you are tuning on your computer/phone you are running tests and your computer sending a message to evey other operating systems to wake up. Truning off means you are saving everything you have done to your hard drive instead of RAM. While its on you are savign a small of memeory to RAM.
